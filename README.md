# Data Analysis Snippets and Example with Pandas and Sklearn

In this repository there are two Python notebooks:
- one named 'Data Analysis Snippets" containing useful code I found/wrote to help me with using Pandas and Sklearn
- one name 'Data Analysis + ML classification example' where I used Pandas and Sklearn to solve a data analysis and classification/evaluation problem

These notebooks are useful to understand how to load, understand, clean and classify data.
A csv dataset is present for the example notebook.

**NOTES**: 
- most of the code comments are in Italian but a lot of the snippets are self explanatory
- the example is taken from the exam of "Big Data Analysis" done at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia
- the code is not mine and coming from various sources, therefore I take no credit to it and this is all under the MIT license
